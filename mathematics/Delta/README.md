# Delta (Δ)

**The Recursive Event Horizon of State Change**

> *"The Delta threshold represents the recursive event horizon of state change. It is not continuous evolution, but quantized collapse-and-rebuild. Each Δ transition encodes a compression of history and projection of new geometry."*

## Overview

In Intent Tensor Theory, **Delta** governs the mechanics of **substrate reconfiguration** — the moment when accumulated intent pressure overcomes memory lock and forces a recursive fold to restructure.

Delta is not a single value but a **threshold membrane** — the boundary where intent becomes geometry.

---

## Master Equation

The Delta state evolves through intent-driven recursive transitions:

$$\vec{\delta}_{n+1} = \hat{\mathfrak{T}}(q_\Phi) \cdot \vec{\delta}_n$$

Where:
- **δ⃗**: The state vector {𝒜, σ_θ, ℳ_ij, n}
- **𝔗̂**: The State Transition Operator
- **q_Φ**: Poke energy (injected glyph intent)

## The Two Deltas

ITT uses Delta in two related but distinct ways:

| Symbol | Name | Definition | Dimension |
|--------|------|------------|-----------|
| **Δ_id** | Identity Kernel | ∇Φ - 𝒞⃗ | 1.5D |
| **δ⃗** | State Vector | {𝒜, σ_θ, ℳ_ij, n} | 2.5D |

**Δ_id** captures the "sacred hesitation" — the misalignment that creates identity.
**δ⃗** bundles the full state of a recursive fold.

See [01_delta_disambiguation](./01_delta_disambiguation/) for full clarification.

## Dimensional Placement

Delta is **transversal** — it bridges folds across the dimensional stack:

| Dimension | Delta Role |
|-----------|------------|
| 1.5D | Δ_id — identity kernel formation |
| 2D | Folded memory surfaces |
| **2.5D** | **δ⃗ threshold membrane (primary home)** |
| 3D | Output geometry begins |
| 3.5D | Charge emission, decoherence |

Delta's operational home is **2.5D** — the threshold membrane of recursive transitions.

## The Three States

| State | Condition | Result |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Stasis** | q_Φ < Λ_L | Intent absorbed; no transition |
| **Dilation** | q_Φ ≈ Λ_L | Alignment strains; coherence weakens |
| **Transition** | q_Φ > Λ_L | Fold breaks; Delta is updated |

## Key Equations

### Threshold Functional
$$\Gamma(\vec{\delta}) = \oint_{\partial\Omega} \frac{\nabla\Phi \cdot d\vec{S}}{\text{Tr}(\mathcal{M}_{ij})}$$

### Shell-Lock Threshold
$$\Lambda_L = \beta \cdot \frac{\text{Tr}(\mathcal{M})}{\mathcal{A}^2}$$

### Entropy Cost
$$\Delta S_\theta = \int_{\tau}^{\tau'} \mathcal{D}(1 - \mathcal{L}) \, d\tau$$

### Transition Likelihood
$$P(\vec{\delta} \to \vec{\delta}') \propto \exp\left(-\frac{|\mathcal{M}'_{ij} - \mathcal{M}_{ij}|_F}{\mathcal{A}}\right)$$

## Integration with ITT Framework

- **[Curvent Calculus](../curvent_calculus/)**: Delta operates on the Curvent flow; Δ_id emerges from ∇Φ - 𝒞⃗
- **[ℛ and Topology](../R_and_Topology/)**: Delta transitions are the mechanism behind rule application in self-resolving systems
- **[ICHTB Coordinate System](../../README.md)**: Recursion depth n maps to hat count

---

## Closing Insight

The Delta transition marks the boundary where **intent becomes geometry** — substrate is restructured to reflect new glyph alignment. It is not continuous evolution, but **quantized collapse-and-rebuild**.

Each δ⃗ transition encodes:
- A **compression of history** (memory tensor update)
- A **projection of new geometry** (curvature reformation)

This is how reality evolves under pressure, with entropy as the toll for meaningful transformation.
