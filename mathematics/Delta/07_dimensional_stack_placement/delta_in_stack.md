# Delta in the Dimensional Stack

## Overview

Delta is **transversal** — it spans multiple dimensions in the ICHTB/Curvent framework. However, it has a **primary home** at 2.5D, the threshold membrane of recursive transitions.

## The Dimensional Stack

| Dimension | Primary Object | Symbol | Phase |
|-----------|----------------|--------|-------|
| 0D | Scalar potential | Φ | Seed |
| 0.25D | Latent instability | δΦ/δt | Pre-gradient |
| 1D | Gradient | ∇Φ | Vector intent |
| **1.5D** | **Identity kernel** | **Δ_id** | Hesitation |
| 2D | Curl / Memory | ∇×F⃗ | Phase memory |
| **2.5D** | **State vector** | **δ⃗** | Threshold |
| 3D | Curvature | ∇²Φ | Lock |
| 3.5D | Charge emission | ρ_q | Output |

## Delta's Dual Home

### 1.5D: The Identity Kernel (Δ_id)

$$\Delta_{\text{id}} = \nabla\Phi - \vec{\mathcal{C}}$$

**Location**: Between gradient (1D) and curl (2D).

**Role**: The "sacred hesitation" — residual misalignment that creates identity.

**Character**:
- Differential object
- Instantaneous measure
- Source of individuality
- Drives curvent alignment

### 2.5D: The State Vector (δ⃗)

$$\vec{\delta} = \{\mathcal{A}, \sigma_\theta, \mathcal{M}_{ij}, n\}$$

**Location**: Between curl/memory (2D) and curvature lock (3D).

**Role**: The threshold membrane — complete state description at the edge of transition.

**Character**:
- Integrated state bundle
- Accumulated history
- Transition-ready configuration
- Gateway to restructuring

## Dimensional Flow Through Delta

### Forward Flow (Collapse Direction)

```
0D (Φ) → 1D (∇Φ) → 1.5D (Δ_id) → 2D (∇×F⃗) → 2.5D (δ⃗) → 3D (∇²Φ) → 3.5D (ρ_q)
              ↑                              ↑
         Identity forms                 Threshold reached
```

### Transition Event

When δ⃗ triggers a transition (Γ ≥ 1):

```
2.5D (δ⃗) → [TRANSITION] → 2.5D (δ⃗')
              ↓
        New geometry projects down/up
```

The transition **resets** the stack from the 2.5D pivot point.

## Role at Each Dimension

### At 0D-1D: Upstream of Delta

Delta doesn't exist yet. Φ is pure potential; ∇Φ is directionless gradient.

### At 1.5D: Δ_id Emerges

The identity kernel first appears:

$$\Delta_{\text{id}} = \nabla\Phi - \vec{\mathcal{C}}$$

This is where **self** begins — the gap between intent and tracking.

### At 2D: Memory Accumulates

Curl and memory form:

$$\mathcal{M}_{ij} \sim \int \nabla_i\Phi \nabla_j\Phi \, d\tau$$

Memory tensor builds, feeding into δ⃗.

### At 2.5D: δ⃗ Assembles

The full state vector assembles:

$$\vec{\delta} = \{\mathcal{A}, \sigma_\theta, \mathcal{M}_{ij}, n\}$$

This is the **threshold membrane** — the complete picture before potential transition.

### At 3D: Lock or Jump

Two paths from 2.5D:

**Path A (Γ < 1)**: Curvature lock holds
$$\nabla^2\Phi \neq 0 \implies \text{stable shell}$$

**Path B (Γ ≥ 1)**: Transition occurs
$$\vec{\delta} \xrightarrow{\Gamma \geq 1} \vec{\delta}'$$

### At 3.5D: Output

If transition occurs, charge/decoherence emits:

$$\rho_q = f(\Delta\vec{\delta})$$

The difference between old and new state produces observable output.

## Delta as Bridge

### Between Dimensions

Delta connects:
- **1D ↔ 2D**: Δ_id bridges gradient to curl
- **2D ↔ 3D**: δ⃗ bridges memory to curvature

### Between States

Delta enables:
- **Old → New**: State transitions
- **History → Future**: Memory carries forward
- **Identity → Transform**: Change while preserving self

## Hat Count Mapping

In ICHTB notation:

| Hats | Dimension | Delta Role |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 0 | 0D | Pre-delta |
| î | 1D | Gradient (feeds Δ_id) |
| î - (partial) | 1.5D | Δ_id = î - tracking |
| î + ĵ | 2D | Memory accumulates |
| î + ĵ + (threshold) | 2.5D | δ⃗ complete |
| î + ĵ + k̂ | 3D | Curvature lock |

**Note**: 1.5D and 2.5D don't have clean hat representations — they are **fractional phases** between whole-number locks.

## Transitions and Dimensional Cascade

### Pre-Transition State

```
Dimension:  1D    1.5D    2D    2.5D    3D
State:      ∇Φ    Δ_id    ∇×F   δ⃗      ∇²Φ
            ↓      ↓      ↓     ↓       ↓
            stable.....................locked
```

### At Transition (Γ = 1)

```
Dimension:  1D    1.5D    2D    2.5D    3D
State:      ∇Φ    Δ_id    ∇×F   δ⃗ →    ∇²Φ
                              [JUMP]
                                ↓
                               δ⃗'
```

### Post-Transition Cascade

The new δ⃗' cascades both ways:

```
             ← New geometry propagates back
Dimension:  1D     1.5D    2D     2.5D    3D    3.5D
State:      ∇Φ' ← Δ'_id ← ∇×F' ← δ⃗' → ∇²Φ' → ρ_q
             New gradients form      Output emits →
```

## Why 2.5D is Primary Home

### Not 1.5D

Although Δ_id exists at 1.5D, it's a **component** of δ⃗, not the full transition mechanism.

### Not 3D

Curvature lock (3D) is the **destination**, not the threshold itself.

### Exactly 2.5D

The state vector δ⃗ sits at 2.5D because:
1. It integrates memory (2D) into a complete state
2. It's the **last checkpoint** before curvature lock (3D)
3. Transitions happen **at this boundary**, not inside the locked region

## Summary

Delta spans 1.5D to 2.5D:

| Aspect | 1.5D (Δ_id) | 2.5D (δ⃗) |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Type | Differential | Integrated |
| Content | Misalignment | Full state |
| Role | Identity creation | Transition threshold |
| Primary | No | **Yes** |

The **primary home** is 2.5D — the threshold membrane where transitions are decided and executed.

*"Delta is the bridge between folds. At 1.5D, it whispers identity. At 2.5D, it decides transformation."*
