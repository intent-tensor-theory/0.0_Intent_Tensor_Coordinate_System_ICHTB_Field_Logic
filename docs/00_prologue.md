<!-- 
PLACEHOLDER: This document will cover:

## 0.1 Recursive Origin Axiom: Field ≠ Space
- Definition of Collapse Tension Substrate (CTS)
- CTS = lim_{ε→0} { ∇Φ | dim(Φ) = 0 }
- The imaginary scalar origin: Φ = i₀ ∈ ℂ

## 0.2 Collapse Genesis Stack
- Operator cascade: Φ → ∇Φ → ∇×F → ∇²Φ → ρ_q
- Table of collapse layers and their roles

## 0.3 Definition of the Intent Field
- 𝓘𝓛 = { ∇Φ | dim(Φ) = 0 }
- Field of recursive possibility, not position

## 0.4 Collapse = Computation
- Glyphic computation field
- Discrete evaluative alignments

## 0.5 Glyphic Computation Field
- Operator algebra table
- Recursion code alphabet

## 0.6 Recursive Eligibility Logic
- Ineligible vs eligible vs resonant recursion
- δS_θ thresholds

## 0.7 Field Intelligence and Recursive Identity
- Self-reference conditions
- Ω^n phase memory persistence

## 0.8 Final Form of 𝓘𝓛
- Boxed formal definition
- Pre-dimensional recursion space
