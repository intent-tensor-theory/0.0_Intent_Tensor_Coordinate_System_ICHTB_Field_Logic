PLACEHOLDER: This document will cover:

## 4.1 Hat Geometry and Recursive Shell Zones
- Hat-grid: tiling of computational microdomains
- ĥ_n(Δᵢ) ∈ {0, 1} permission cells
- Shell site = ⋂_{i=1}^{6} ĥ_n(Δᵢ) = 1

## 4.2 Grid as Collapse Eligibility Map
- ℍ_grid = { ĥ_{ijk} | eligibility: f(Δ) }
- Recursion accessibility, not distance

## 4.3 Graft Lines as Recursive Navigation Beams
- ℒ_{ab} directed path conditions
- Operator continuity, memory alignment, gradient preservation

## 4.4 Shell Counting via Discrete Hat Domains
- N_shell = Σ_{paths} Π_{n} ĥ_n
- Recursive-valid shell enumeration

## 4.5 Recursive Fan Overlap Zones
- ĥ_n^{Δᵢ∩Δⱼ} = ĥ_n^{Δᵢ} · ĥ_n^{Δⱼ}
- High-symmetry recursion nodes (hypernodes)
